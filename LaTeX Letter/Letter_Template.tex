		\opening{Greetings neighbors,}
		
		It has come to my recent attention that there is a tremendous level of sound traveling through our building. To this I have concluded that you (my neighbors) are dinosaurs. I would like to express my sympathy towards how it must feel to have a large head and small arms. I would like to suggest the following regulations take effect.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Please refrain from playing football indoors.
			\item Please do not play catch with your furniture.
			\item If you insist on wearing a chicken suit, please do not run around making duck sounds at the same time... or ever.
			\item I understand that humans sometimes have the urge to Yodel as loud as they can. Please don't.
			\item I understand kids are noisy as well, I was one once. Please use a muzzle.
			\item There is a cat that hangs around outside every morning, someone should really take care of that before it starts looking to us humans as food.
			\item Please do not fart in the elevator.
			\item Please do not perform exorcisms late into the evening.
		\end{itemize}
		If you are unable to adhere to these suggested rules, I would advise seeking medical help. Have a wonderful day.
		\signature{Neighbor}
		
		\closing{Sincerely, your concerned neighbor,}
